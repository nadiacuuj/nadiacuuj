# 👋 Hi, I'm Nadia

I've always had a knack for uncovering hidden patterns—whether in data, music, or storytelling. Two decades as a die-hard Taylor Swift fan sharpened my ability to spot hidden patterns—decoding Easter eggs, tracking number sequences, and making wild (but often accurate) predictions.  

This fascination only deepened when my dad introduced his favorite show, *Numb3rs*, to me as a kid. I vividly remember how captivated I was by how Charlie Eppes was using math in the most insanely beautiful way possible, like locating a murder suspect by analyzing water droplets from a sprinkler.  

Now, I bring that same curiosity, creativity, and data-driven mindset to **data science**, blending analytical thinking with problem-solving to extract meaningful insights from complex systems.  

### 📌 About Me
